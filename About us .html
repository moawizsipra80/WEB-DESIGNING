    <div class="companyhistory">
    <p>The inherited values and deep-rooted passion for business education fueled my drive to excel in sales and marketing. In
    1991, I took the initiative to expand our family business, launching the infant company “Orient Marketing.” We embarked
    on export and local sales activities, exporting Hand Knotted Woolen Carpets & Rugs, Towels, and Handicrafts to Malaysia,
    Korea, Singapore, and the UAE, while also offering Electrical Appliances and O&M services in telecommunications and
    industrial chemicals locally.
    
    However, the economic and political challenges of the time created a vicious cycle that affected many businesses,
    including Orient Marketing. As the environment became more difficult, investments drained, and we were forced to pause
    the company’s operations for a few years.
    
    During this period, I gained invaluable experience as the Regional Head of After-Sales Service for a leading HVAC
    manufacturing company, often referred to as the “Mother of HVAC manufacturers in Pakistan.” My journey continued with
    remarkable achievements in project management for HVAC systems, including collaborations with US-AID and IOM in
    Afghanistan, and successful HVAC projects for power plants in the energy sector.
    
    Over the span of 23 years, I honed my technical and professional expertise in Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning,
    and Refrigeration (HVAC-R), duct systems, and pipework. These strengths became the foundation of “Orient Marketing,”
    allowing us to provide quality engineering and technical support at every stage of project implementation, from concept
    to commissioning, for our valued customers.
    
    Building on this strong legacy, in 2023, we launched AQS ODM, a specialized department under the umbrella of Orient
    Marketing. AQS ODM is dedicated to providing cutting-edge digital marketing solutions that align with the modern demands
    of our clients. With a focus on innovation, strategic thinking, and quality service, AQS ODM is poised to lead in the
    digital marketing landscape, continuing the tradition of excellence established by Orient Marketing.</p>
